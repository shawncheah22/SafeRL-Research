# SafeRL-Research

**A research-focused environment for experimenting & developing Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms.**

This repository is designed for **developing, validating, and benchmarking safe RL methods**, both standard and custom. It’s intended as a **playground for RL research** where safety constraints, hazard-aware learning, and novel algorithmic ideas can be tested.

## Overview

SafeRL-Research is built to:

- Provide a **modular framework** for testing RL algorithms under safety constraints.
- Support both **standard RL algorithms** (DQN, PPO, SAC, etc.) and **custom innovations**.
- Facilitate **benchmarking and evaluation** in environments with hazards or safety-critical requirements.
- Serve as a **demonstration of advanced RL expertise** for recruiters, collaborators, and the research community.

## Key Features

- **Safe RL Focus:** Handle environments with penalties, hazards, or risk constraints.
- **Modular Algorithm Implementation:** Easily swap out policies, reward functions, and exploration strategies.
- **Custom Experiments:** Designed for testing novel RL ideas, risk-sensitive policies, or LLM-guided RL.
- **Visualization Tools:** Track performance, costs, and safety violations over time.
- **Benchmarking Support:** Compare performance across multiple algorithms and safety metrics.
